      <h2>About us</h2>
      <p>
        After following the Grateful Dead on tour for 20 years. We just missed
        much of the culture and experiences of being on the road. So we opened
        Grateful Cheese. Here you can enjoy the same quality grilled cheese you
        would enjoy in the parking lot of any Dead show. And for the
        <strong>10 times</strong> the price! You're Welcome!

      <h2>Our Hero</h2>
      <h3>Jerry Garcia</h3>
      <img src="./images/jerryt1.png" />
      <p>
        Jerry was fundamental in the creation of this restaurant. He wasn't
        involved with the restaurant. However, had he not been a found of the
        Grateful Dead the stars would never have aligned for us to provide the
        Tampa area with the headiest grilled cheese sandwiches.
